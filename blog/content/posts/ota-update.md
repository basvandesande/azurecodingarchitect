When time passes by, it is likely that either requirements or conditions are changing and that the device is not capable anymore of doind its job. In other words, it needs to be updated. This is where the real problems may start. In many cases devices are not physically accessible or there are simply too many devices in the field to do manual updates. This is where over-the-air (OTA) updates will save your day.
