You have found my personal blog. This blog will be focused around Microsoft Azure technologies, hence the name "something Azure". Let me introduce myself, my name is Bas van de Sande and I work as an Azure Coding Architect at [**Xpirit**](https://www.xpirit.com) in the Netherlands.

As part of  my daily job, I offer technical guidance, advice and hands-on assistance for a large number of (global) companies in various industries. 

I have been working with Microsoft technologies since 1995 in various technical roles, since that time I have seen a large number of technologies passing by (Visual Studio technologies, SQL Server, BizTalk, Microsoft.Net, SharePoint, Dynamics CE etc). In one of my former jobs I have been doing product development on the Dynamics CE platform annd back then I used to blog very actively on my journey into CRM. Over the years I came to realize, that the continuous story of my life is system integration.  

About three years ago, I got more and more involved in Microsoft Azure. In order to learn as much as I could about this fascinating platform, I decided to start studying again. After a devoting my evening hours, I passed the most important certification exams: Microsoft Azure Administrator Associate, Microsoft Azure DevOps Engineer Expert, Microsoft Azure Solution Architect Expert, Microsoft Azure Security Associate and Microsoft Azure IoT Developer. By the time I passed these exams, I realized that the the time had come for me to join the experts at Xpirit. 

In this blog I'll write about my learnings and insights. Furthermore I'll be with (for me) new technologies. I might help you to avoid some pitfalls or it might spark some inspiration to start doing epic sh*t!  

I hope you enjoy this blog,

Bas.
