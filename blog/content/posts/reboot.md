Almost a year ago I created this blog... I mean not exactly this blog, but its predecessor "blog.somethingazure.com". 
I thought that the name did match the content. Fast Forward a couple of months in time.... I learned that my job as Azure Coding Architect involved quite a few more technology areas than just Azure. Furthermore I was not happy with the look-and-feel of the blog; it was visually not attractive. Time for a major overhaul!

## Ditch the old domain name
The first step was to thing of a new name for the blog. I was thinking of names like "techbytes.com" in which I could serve small bites of technology where *byte* had a double meaning as I work in IT. But as usual, most catchy domain names have been taken already. Suddenly I dawned to me: I work as a technical solution architect, I love coding and I focus primarily on  Azure. In my daytime job, I picked the function title Azure Coding Architect. So why not extend it to a blog? This domain name turned out to be available... 

## Get rid of the boring design
At Xpirit, one of our four core principles is "Quality without a compromise". In this blog, I want to give my best. Therefor step 1 was to upgrade the design. The theme had to be slick, visually appealing and consistent.

I looked at the templates available for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and stumbled on the great [Bilberry Hugo theme](https://github.com/Lednerb/bilberry-hugo-theme). I made some small changes to the css files to get the color scheme I envisioned. The next step was to get a consistent and appealing look by adding a colorful image at the top of each article.

The overhaul - with the colorful graphics and smooth fonts gives this blog much more the look and feel of a fancy magazine.

## Broader content
As I got rid of the old name "somethingAzure", I feel less constrained in the choice of posts I want to write. Inspired by all sorts of master classes, innovation days, side projects, lectures and technologies I already have some ideas of the articles I want to write. The Azure Coding Architect blog gives me a blanc canvas to write all sorts of conceptual, inspirational and techinal articles.   

Happy times ahead!
