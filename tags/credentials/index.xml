As soon as I start I receive an invitation from Github to join the customer&amp;rsquo;s Github organization. Most of the organization have a SAML based single sign on (SSO).
After joining the organization using my personal Github account, I&amp;rsquo;m able to work on the repositories on which I have access. So far so good&amp;hellip;&lt;/p>
