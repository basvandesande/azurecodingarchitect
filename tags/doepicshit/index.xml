This blog will be focused around Microsoft Azure technologies, hence the name &amp;ldquo;something Azure&amp;rdquo;. Let me introduce myself, my name is Bas van de Sande and I work as an Azure Coding Architect at &lt;a href="https://www.xpirit.com">&lt;strong>Xpirit&lt;/strong>&lt;/a> in the Netherlands.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As part of my daily job, I offer technical guidance, advice and hands-on assistance for a large number of (global) companies in various industries.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have been working with Microsoft technologies since 1995 in various technical roles, since that time I have seen a large number of technologies passing by (Visual Studio technologies, SQL Server, BizTalk, Microsoft.Net, SharePoint, Dynamics CE etc). In one of my former jobs I have been doing product development on the Dynamics CE platform annd back then I used to blog very actively on my journey into CRM. Over the years I came to realize, that the continuous story of my life is system integration.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
