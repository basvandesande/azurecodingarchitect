They help me to build and deploy my Azure environments, without having me to do all the tedious and errorprone work. I create a pull request, have it peer reviewed and once approved my environments are provisoned the way I envisioned it. This is also the case at my current assignment for a large organization.

This means that every step in the process needs to be documented and approved conform ITIL processes.&lt;/p></description></item></channel></rss>
