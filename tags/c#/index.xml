From time-to-time you get confronted with legacy technologies, robust but boring. One of such things is a piece of software I wrote more than 15 years ago for a friend. It was an application using a SQL Server database that controlled a couple of weighing terminals connected over RS232. Controlling machines is every geek&amp;rsquo;s dream.</description></item><item><title>Note to self: localhost in kestrel is localhost</title><link>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/localhost_in_kestrel/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Feb 2022 17:20:25 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/localhost_in_kestrel/</guid><description>In one of the projects I&amp;rsquo;m involved in, I ran into a problem. In this project we are building a solution that is running on a Linux based Edge Device connected to Azure. On the Edge device, a k3s cluster hosts a number of services required by the solution. In order to be able to develop and debug on a Linux environment, I equiped my system with Hyper-V, an internal NAT switch and a fresh copy of Ubuntu.</description></item></channel></rss>
