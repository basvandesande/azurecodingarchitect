Back in the days I wrote software for PalmOS devices, and I was intrigued by having raw processor power in my Pocket. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, back then we where talking Megahertz instead of Gigahertz and Kilobyte instead of Gigabyte. Having such limitations in processing power and memory tickled my creativity. When I had the opportunity to control hardware (gps, electronic locks etc) using the little devices I was sold.</description></item><item><title>Running a persistent SQL Server in Docker</title><link>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/persistent-sql-docker/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Mar 2022 17:46:30 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/persistent-sql-docker/</guid><description>In IT we always want to work with the latest and greatest, it&amp;rsquo;s in our DNA to explore new technologies. From time-to-time you get confronted with legacy technologies, robust but boring. One of such things is a piece of software I wrote more than 15 years ago for a friend. It was an application using a SQL Server database that controlled a couple of weighing terminals connected over RS232. Controlling machines is every geek&amp;rsquo;s dream.</description></item><item><title>Note to self: localhost in kestrel is localhost</title><link>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/localhost_in_kestrel/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Feb 2022 17:20:25 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/localhost_in_kestrel/</guid><description>In one of the projects I&amp;rsquo;m involved in, I ran into a problem. In this project we are building a solution that is running on a Linux based Edge Device connected to Azure. On the Edge device, a k3s cluster hosts a number of services required by the solution. In order to be able to develop and debug on a Linux environment, I equiped my system with Hyper-V, an internal NAT switch and a fresh copy of Ubuntu.</description></item></channel></rss>
