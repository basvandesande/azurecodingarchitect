When time passes by, it is likely that either requirements or conditions are changing and that the device is not capable anymore of doing its job. In other words, it needs to be updated. This is where the real problems may start. In many cases devices are not physically accessible or there are simply too many devices in the field to do manual updates.</description></item><item><title>Register ESP32 to DPS &amp; IoT hub - IoT with C#</title><link>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/iot-nanoframework-dps/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Apr 2022 21:09:06 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/iot-nanoframework-dps/</guid><description>In my previous post I flashed my ESP32 with the nanoframework.net, allowing me to write C# code in Visual Studio with all bells and whistles. As life goes&amp;hellip; the device landed in my drawer until this week where I had some time to experiment. This time I wanted to hook up the device to Azure IoT hub using the Device Provisioning Service (DPS) which brings me one step closer to my goal, performing device updates over-the-air&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>From 0 to 100 in 30 minutes - IoT with C#</title><link>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/prepare-for-iot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2022 20:28:06 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/prepare-for-iot/</guid><description>My interest for the Internet of Things (IoT) was sparked many moons ago, way before the name was born. Back in the days I wrote software for PalmOS devices, and I was intrigued by having raw processor power in my Pocket. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, back then we where talking Megahertz instead of Gigahertz and Kilobyte instead of Gigabyte. Having such limitations in processing power and memory tickled my creativity. When I had the opportunity to control hardware (gps, electronic locks etc) using the little devices I was sold.</description></item><item><title>Running a persistent SQL Server in Docker</title><link>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/persistent-sql-docker/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Mar 2022 17:46:30 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/persistent-sql-docker/</guid><description>In IT we always want to work with the latest and greatest, it&amp;rsquo;s in our DNA to explore new technologies. From time-to-time you get confronted with legacy technologies, robust but boring. One of such things is a piece of software I wrote more than 15 years ago for a friend. It was an application using a SQL Server database that controlled a couple of weighing terminals connected over RS232. Controlling machines is every geek&amp;rsquo;s dream.</description></item><item><title>Note to self: localhost in kestrel is localhost</title><link>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/localhost_in_kestrel/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Feb 2022 17:20:25 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/localhost_in_kestrel/</guid><description>In one of the projects I&amp;rsquo;m involved in, I ran into a problem. In this project we are building a solution that is running on a Linux based Edge Device connected to Azure. On the Edge device, a k3s cluster hosts a number of services required by the solution. In order to be able to develop and debug on a Linux environment, I equiped my system with Hyper-V, an internal NAT switch and a fresh copy of Ubuntu.</description></item></channel></rss>
