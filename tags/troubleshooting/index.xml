The idea of an Innovation Day is to work on technologies or topics that sparked your interest. Anything is allowed, as long as it has nothing to do with any customer assignments. Learning and sharing is the goal of such day.
At our last Innovation Day in november, I picked up the idea to get some hands on experience with the Windows Dev Kit 2023 also known as Project Volterra.</description></item><item><title>Note to self: localhost in kestrel is localhost</title><link>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/localhost_in_kestrel/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Feb 2022 17:20:25 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/localhost_in_kestrel/</guid><description>In one of the projects I&amp;rsquo;m involved in, I ran into a problem. In this project we are building a solution that is running on a Linux based Edge Device connected to Azure. On the Edge device, a k3s cluster hosts a number of services required by the solution. In order to be able to develop and debug on a Linux environment, I equiped my system with Hyper-V, an internal NAT switch and a fresh copy of Ubuntu.</description></item></channel></rss>
