Looking back I think I had this idea that world class conferences could only be held in the US (or in a place far-far away from home) with thousands of visitors. I was dead wrong. What the organizers understood perfectly is that in order to have a world class conference, you should offer the same smooth, convenient and rich experience with the very best speakers, but then at a smaller scale.</description></item><item><title>Register ESP32 to DPS &amp; IoT hub - IoT with C#</title><link>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/iot-nanoframework-dps/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Apr 2022 21:09:06 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/iot-nanoframework-dps/</guid><description>In my previous post I flashed my ESP32 with the nanoframework.net, allowing me to write C# code in Visual Studio with all bells and whistles. As life goes&amp;hellip; the device landed in my drawer until this week where I had some time to experiment. This time I wanted to hook up the device to Azure IoT hub using the Device Provisioning Service (DPS) which brings me one step closer to my goal, performing device updates over-the-air&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>From 0 to 100 in 30 minutes - IoT with C#</title><link>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/prepare-for-iot/</link><pubDate>Tue, 15 Mar 2022 20:28:06 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/prepare-for-iot/</guid><description>My interest for the Internet of Things (IoT) was sparked many moons ago, way before the name was born. Back in the days I wrote software for PalmOS devices, and I was intrigued by having raw processor power in my Pocket. Don&amp;rsquo;t get me wrong, back then we where talking Megahertz instead of Gigahertz and Kilobyte instead of Gigabyte. Having such limitations in processing power and memory tickled my creativity. When I had the opportunity to control hardware (gps, electronic locks etc) using the little devices I was sold.</description></item><item><title>Running a persistent SQL Server in Docker</title><link>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/persistent-sql-docker/</link><pubDate>Sat, 05 Mar 2022 17:46:30 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/persistent-sql-docker/</guid><description>In IT we always want to work with the latest and greatest, it&amp;rsquo;s in our DNA to explore new technologies. From time-to-time you get confronted with legacy technologies, robust but boring. One of such things is a piece of software I wrote more than 15 years ago for a friend. It was an application using a SQL Server database that controlled a couple of weighing terminals connected over RS232. Controlling machines is every geek&amp;rsquo;s dream.</description></item><item><title>Note to self: localhost in kestrel is localhost</title><link>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/localhost_in_kestrel/</link><pubDate>Wed, 23 Feb 2022 17:20:25 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/localhost_in_kestrel/</guid><description>In one of the projects I&amp;rsquo;m involved in, I ran into a problem. In this project we are building a solution that is running on a Linux based Edge Device connected to Azure. On the Edge device, a k3s cluster hosts a number of services required by the solution. In order to be able to develop and debug on a Linux environment, I equiped my system with Hyper-V, an internal NAT switch and a fresh copy of Ubuntu.</description></item><item><title>Sometimes you need to reboot...</title><link>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/reboot/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Feb 2022 11:31:42 +0100</pubDate><guid>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/reboot/</guid><description>Almost a year ago I created this blog&amp;hellip; I mean not exactly this blog, but its predecessor &amp;ldquo;blog.somethingazure.com&amp;rdquo;. I thought that the name did match the content. Fast Forward a couple of months in time&amp;hellip;. I learned that my job as Azure Coding Architect involved quite a few more technology areas than just Azure. Furthermore I was not happy with the look-and-feel of the blog; it was visually not attractive. Time for a major overhaul!</description></item><item><title>Multi-staged GitHub Pipeline</title><link>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/mutistage-gh-pipeline/</link><pubDate>Sat, 11 Sep 2021 19:46:30 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/mutistage-gh-pipeline/</guid><description>At the moment I&amp;rsquo;m working on some infrastructure pipelines to build and deploy Azure infrastructure for one of our clients. For me a cool project as I&amp;rsquo;m learning to work with technologies such as Bicep and GitHub actions. In this project we use GitHub actions for the CI/CD process. In this process every time a pull request is merged in the main branch, an automated build, test and deployment process is triggered.</description></item><item><title>Certification Renewal</title><link>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/certification-renewal/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Aug 2021 19:30:08 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/certification-renewal/</guid><description>When Microsoft introduced the new role based certifaction paths, a new expiration policy was set as well. After two years (as of july 2021, one year) the certification will expire, and you have to renew it in order to keep it.
At the time, I was among the first people who passed the new certifications and back then the new expiration policy was unclear. There was no information on how to renew the certifications and costs involved, until a few weeks ago&amp;hellip;</description></item><item><title>DevOps All the Way</title><link>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/devops-all-the-way/</link><pubDate>Fri, 30 Jul 2021 09:00:06 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/devops-all-the-way/</guid><description>In Practice what you preach I wrote that I decided to host my blog on the Azure platform, using Hugo as content management system, Blob Storage and Azure CDN for hosting the blog. The only thing lacking is a workflow of writing content, approving it and publishing it on the web.
As I work for a company that specialized on Azure and DevOps, I decided to take the plunge and go DevOps all the way.</description></item><item><title>Practice what you preach!</title><link>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/practice-what-you-preach/</link><pubDate>Tue, 27 Jul 2021 10:14:26 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/practice-what-you-preach/</guid><description>When I decided to start blogging again, I knew I wanted to talk about the things I face, working with Azure. In the past I used to blog as well, back then I blogged on my Journey into CRM which I started in 2014.
In 2014 the state of technology was much different; one would use WordPress (or similar). The main choice was host it yourself or host it at a hosting provider.</description></item><item><title>Introduction</title><link>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/introduction/</link><pubDate>Sat, 24 Jul 2021 12:20:25 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://azurecodingarchitect.com/posts/introduction/</guid><description>You have found my personal blog. This blog will be focused around Microsoft Azure technologies, hence the name &amp;ldquo;something Azure&amp;rdquo;. Let me introduce myself, my name is Bas van de Sande and I work as an Azure Coding Architect at Xpirit in the Netherlands.
As part of my daily job, I offer technical guidance, advice and hands-on assistance for a large number of (global) companies in various industries.
I have been working with Microsoft technologies since 1995 in various technical roles, since that time I have seen a large number of technologies passing by (Visual Studio technologies, SQL Server, BizTalk, Microsoft.</description></item></channel></rss>
